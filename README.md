# LaColorduino - Your own Smartwatch how it should be
![Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/master/IMG_2067.JPG)

**[Click me for a short video demo (OLD)](https://twitter.com/TheAmadeus25/status/1095430617074937860)**

**[Sneak-Peak with comment in GER and ENG](http://bit.ly/UWGSmartwatch1)**

I build my own clone of LaMetric smartwatch but with 5 Colorduino. It will make use of an ESP8266 NodeMCU for the connection to the Internet. It's build for everyday use like showing your subscribers on **[YouTube](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#youtube)**, follower on **[Twitter](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#twitter)**, clicks on **[Twitch](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#twitch)** or the **[Weather](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#weather)** at the moment. Even live-stats of **[CounterStrike: Global Offensive](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#counterstrike-global-offensive)** it's supported! What do you want more? Wait, don't say it loud, it also has a **[dark-mode](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino#clock-dark-mode)**. In the future, there is  everything for everybody and everything is self-made! Maybe we can create something very big for the world?

‚ùî Interested? Well, read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/wiki)** and you will get Happy, yay.

üò• However, the Wiki isn't completed, yet. That's a hole bunch of work and I change almost everytime something about this project.

‚ö† It seems, that something has changed inside the API's. Sometimes the clock works without any problems, sometimes it doesn't show a valid number. Due COVID-19 I don't have much time. I'm working around 60h per week, cos lack of workers.

# Preview of Watchfaces

## Clock
It shows the current time downloaded from a NTP-Server every few seconds. I'll try to use the clock-cycle to lower the count of requests. Currently, it shows the time in 24h. In the future I add AM/PM mode as well. Icon isn't animated and doesn't show the current time. Maybe I update this.

### Clock (day)

![Preview Clock Day](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Clock/IMG_0705.JPG?raw=true)

### Clock (dark-mode)
**Dark-Mode** is supported which mean, it lower the light to the lowest value possible. It's very handy at night, because the icon doesn't appear and it stays at clock. _(It still refreshes information in background all the time, so it can act very fast if needed.)_

![Preview Clock Night](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Clock/IMG_0841.jpg?raw=true)

******
## Indoor
Based on the **BME280** sensor, it give you some information like **temperature**, **humidity** and **air-pressure**.

### Temperature

It show the current temperature in **Celsius** _(¬∞C)_, **Fahrenheit** _(¬∞F)_ and **Kelvin** _(K)_. The logo is animated. Depending on the current temperature it change it's color and the level indicator:
* Ice-Blue _(Current not in use)_
* Blue _(T < 22¬∞C)_
* Green _(22¬∞C ‚â§ T < 25¬∞C)_
* Yellow _(25¬∞C ‚â§ T < 30¬∞C)_
* Red _(30¬∞C ‚â§ T)_

******
## Weather

Based on **[openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/)** it show the current **weather** at your location. It change the icon as well, depending on the weather. **[Here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)** is a list which is more accurate. I did an update of all weather symbols due lack of space (reducing around 8%). However, this should match better to this Social-Gamer-Smartwatch.

## YouTube

The ESP8266 get its information directly from **YouTube** it's self. Sometimes, it doesn't show any value after startup but I'm working on it. **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-youtube-api)**.

### Subscriber

This watchface shows how many people are **subscribed** to your YouTube channel.

![Preview YouTube Subscriber](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0730.JPG?raw=true)

### View

It also shows you how many **total views** you have already. Currently, non of my counters support numbers higher than 99.999.999. I'll change this later to something more readable like 99.99M.

![Preview YouTube View](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0738.JPG?raw=true)

### Comment

This one is confusing me. The **[official API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/?apix=true)** says something about current/new comments, but that's not true. Maybe they mean new Inbox messages but I can't test this; I never get any messages üò•üòã

![Preview YouTube Comment](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/YouTube/IMG_0739.jpg?raw=true)

### Video

Did you know, how many videos are currently public (not uploaded)? Well, now you know it.

******
## Twitch

Now, you reach the more important part of this Smartwatch. It gets its information directly from **Twitch**, same like YouTube before. In the future I try to add a Watchface which shows if you are currently online/streaming. I'm pretty sure, it looks great on camera while streaming! **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino_twitch_api)**.

### Follower

This counter shows you, how many people are **subscribed** to your Twitch channel.

![Preview Twitch Follower](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/LaColorduino/blob/master/Photos/Twitch/IMG_0731.JPG?raw=true)

## Twitter

Socialmedia gets more important these days. So how about a watchface as well? It works same like Twitch and YouTube before. **[Library from witnessmenow aka Brian Lough found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-twitter-api)**

### Follower

How many people are **following** you.

## Powermeter Watchface ([Video](https://imgur.com/gallery/6YIdLtq))

You need extra hardware to make this run _(ESP with Built-in button + INA226)_. I'll uploade the sourcecode for the second device later. However, this measuring works completly over WiFi! The **Slave ESP** is measuring the **Voltage**, **Current** and calculate the **Power**. It transmit this Information **over Wi-Fi** to the Social-Gamer-Smartwatch. **[UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)** helps a lot for this use case! If you want to switch between all units, just press the button on the **Slave ESP** and it will change on the Smartwatch, as well. It's very easy and you can use your own measuring instead of **INA226**!

## CounterStrike: Global Offensive 

Yes my friend, it's true! It can show you your **current stats** as well! I just modified the **[official API from Valve](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration)** a little. It shows you:
* Kill
* Assist
* Death
* Health _(as progressbar)_
* Who wins _(CT or T)_
* Bomb state _(defused or exploded)(it override who win)_

TBH, this watchface need additional **[script](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio/tree/master/Sourcecode)** and **[software](https://nodejs.org/de/download/)** which I also uploaded **[here](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio)**. Just follow the **[wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio/wiki)**. Currently, it's input-lag is at ~6 milliseconds _(~166Hz)_ which is fast enough for such a device! It's not possible to decrease input-lag over Wi-Fi even more.

### Livestats

You can change the delimiter of this watchface into one of the following character:
* Space
* Slash
* Dot
* Vertical line
* Colon
* Hyphen
* Asterix

## Update-over-Air (OTA) 

This one is just for the ESP8266 itself. It's not possible to update the Colorduino in this build over the air. The Icon is animated and rotating while receiving data. Based on its colour it shows you the current state _(progress, succeeded, failed)_. Someday, if this project is finished, I make this process obsolete. Everything should be configured on a web browser. It doesn't mean I'll remove this feature, maybe it got a bugfix or an update. OTA would be very handy.

* **[USB to TTL-Converter with CP2102](https://www.amazon.de/SODIAL-USB-TTL-Konverter-Modul-eingebautem-CP2102/dp/B008RF73CS/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534713779&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=cp2102+breakout)** _(or similar)_
* ~Help of the community~
  * Testing
  * Bug fixing
  * Optimize
  * ~Adding feature~

## Additional to the software, it requires some hardware
* 5x Colorduino Matrix Shield _(it's possible up to 254 but never testing/using)_
* 5x Colorduino Matrix 8x8 RGB LED Full Dot/Square _(Feel free to mixed them up)_
  * 1st shows the symbol/logo, everything else shows the information
* LDR _(if it's dark, watchface change to clock with lowest light so you can sleep at night without any glare)_
* 3x Button _(not planed to use all of them at the moment)_
* BME280 _(for indoor use)_
* ADS1115 _(or similar for those Buttons and LDR. Yeah, 15-bit resolution is an overkill üòÑ)_
* ~5V-3.3V Level Shifter (if I use an ESP8266-01)~
* DC-DC 12V to 5V and 3.3V Step-down Power Supply
  * We need at least 3.3V/5V for ESP8266 and 6.5V to 7.5V for RGB Matrix, at least 1A+.
* Messing Spacer _(for mounting)_
